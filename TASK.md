# Sentiment & Trend Reporting Dashboard
## Step-by-Step Task List

---

## Step 1: Setup Environment

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment for backend development.
- Install necessary Python packages for FastAPI, data processing, and NLP`pip install pandas transformers torch scikit-learn fastapi uvicorn`
- Initialize React frontend project and install necessary libraries for charts and HTTP requests.
- Choose and set up a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) for styling.

---

## Step 2: Data Preparation & Sentiment Analysis

- Load the Instagram comments dataset.
- Clean the dataset by removing or handling missing or invalid comment entries.
- Apply a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify comments into sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative).
- Assign confidence scores to sentiment predictions.
- Save the processed dataset with sentiment labels and scores for backend use.

---

## Step 3: Backend API Development

- Set up a FastAPI application.
- Load the processed sentiment dataset when the backend starts.
- Implement API endpoints to:
    - Provide overall sentiment summary.
    - Return sentiment trends aggregated weekly.
    - Extract and return trending keywords from comments.
    - Retrieve top comments filtered by sentiment and confidence.
    - Group sentiment data by product/media caption keywords.
    - Provide word frequency data suitable for word cloud visualization.
    - Return daily comment volume statistics.
- Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow frontend requests.

---

## Step 4: Frontend UI Development

- Set up the React application structure and global styling.
- Create components for:
    - Sentiment distribution pie chart.
    - Weekly sentiment trend line chart.
    - Word cloud visualization.
    - Trending keywords list.
    - Top comments viewer with filtering options.
- Integrate API calls using Axios to fetch data from the backend.
- Implement filter controls such as sentiment type and date range selectors.
- Style components consistently with the chosen CSS framework.

---

## Step 5: Testing & Validation

- Write and run unit tests for backend API endpoints.
- Verify accuracy and quality of sentiment analysis results.
- Test frontend components with mock data and live backend data.
- Check for UI responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Address bugs, improve error handling, and ensure edge cases are covered.

---

## Step 6: Deployment Preparation

- Optimize backend server configuration for production readiness.
- Build the frontend application for production deployment.
- Choose hosting platforms for backend and frontend.
- Prepare environment variables and secure sensitive information.
- (Optional) Containerize the backend service using Docker.

---

## Step 7: Deployment & Monitoring

- Deploy backend and frontend applications to production environments.
- Perform end-to-end testing to confirm system stability.
- Set up monitoring and logging for backend API performance and errors.
- Collect user feedback for further improvements.

---

## Optional Stretch Goals

- Implement topic modeling to discover common themes in comments.
- Add automatic summarization of comments using NLP.
- Develop time-series forecasting for sentiment trends.
- Implement user authentication for managing multiple brands.
- Offer a GraphQL API alternative to REST for flexible data queries.
